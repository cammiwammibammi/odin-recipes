    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>12 sheets dry lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 lb mozzarella, shredded</li>
        <li>8 oz parmesan, grated</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Meat Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>28 oz marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Italian seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Bechamel</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup AP flour</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <h4>Meat Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, add olive oil. Add the italian seasoning and red pepper flakes. Saute for 30 seconds and add the onion. Continue cooking on medium-high heat until the onion is soft, 2 minutes. Add the garlic, stirring constantly for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and brown meat over medium-high heat, breaking the meat apart into pieces with spoon. When cooked drain excess grease and transfer to food processor. Pulse several times until crumbly and nearly pureed.</li>
        <li>Return mixture to the skillet or Dutch oven and add the Marinara Sauce (recipe linked above). Stir to combine the meat and marinara sauce.</li>
        <li>Cover and allow the sauce to simmer for about 20 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally. Add 1 cup of water if it gets too thick and continue cooking to reduce.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Bechamel Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm the milk in a saucepan or microwave.</li>
        <li>In a medium sauce pan melt equal parts butter and then the flour with the salt and white pepper.</li>
        <li>Whisk the flour and butter together and allow to simmer on low to cook the flour 1-2 minutes. The lightest (white color) roux will be slightly puffed.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the warm milk and whisk to incorporate until a smooth sauce forms on low heat. Cook several minutes, sauce will thicken. Set aside.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Lasagna Assembly</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a 9×13″ baking dish add the dry lasagna noodles and cover with hot water. Allow to rest for 20 minutes. Drain into a large colander.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease the 9×13″ baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Start by spreading some of the meat sauce on bottom of greased dish. Layer on top with 3 lasagna noodles or more to cover bottom.</li>
        <li>Spread more meat sauce over the noodles, followed by the Bechamel Sauce (recipe above), then mozzarella and parmesan cheeses, spreading all to the edges.</li>
        <li>Repeat this 3-4 times to use up all noodles, sauces and ending with cheeses on top.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes until top is golden brown and cheeses are bubbling. Allow the lasagna to rest for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
