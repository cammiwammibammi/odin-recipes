    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>White beans in tomato stew.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2 cups dry white beans</li>
            <li>1-2 lbs stewing meat</li>
            <li>2 onions, diced</li>
            <li>5 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by soaking the white beans in a bowl overnight in 5 cups of water. They should roughly double in size the next day and yield close to 4 cups of beans</li>
        <li>Season the meat with ½ teaspoon of salt and ¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>Add the vegetable oil to the instant pot along with the meat and sear for 5-6 minutes on sauté mode, flipping on all sides until browned</li>
        <li>Meanwhile finely dice the onions, then add them to the pot and continue to cook for 5 minutes. Add ½ teaspoon of salt to help the onions cook down</li>
        <li>Add 5 tablespoons of tomato paste and stir with the onions and the meat, allowing it to caramelize for 2-3 minutes</li>
        <li>Add the drained beans along with 5.5 cups of water, 1 and ¼ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Mix everything together</li>
        <li>Pressure cook on high for 8 minutes. If you're using the stovetop, boil everything for 1 to 1.5 hours until meat and beans are tender. You may need to replenish the water as the level goes down, so check on it every 20 minutes or so adjust</li>
        <li>Manually release the pressure and open the lid. Check the stew for seasoning and simmer it for 10-15 minutes on sauté mode. This step will help thicken the stew broth and balance all the flavours</li>
        <li>Serve with white rice, salad, and some yogurt and enjoy</li>
